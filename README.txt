Ninner Food Rescue Hub 

Files included:
- index.html, events.html, volunteer.html, impact.html, contact.html
- styles.css
- scripts.js
- events.json 
- impact.json 

New Interactive Components Added:
1. Image Carousel (Homepage) - Auto-rotating image showcase with navigation controls
2. Tabbed Interface (Impact Page) - Organized content with animated progress bars
3. Modal Gallery (Events Page) - Interactive image viewing with keyboard navigation

How to use:
1) Extract zip to your webpages hosting directory (or GitHub Pages root).
2) Ensure all files are uploaded to the same folder.
3) Open index.html in browser to view the site.
4) The site uses local JSON files (events.json, impact.json) to populate Events and Impact pages.
   If you upload to a hosting provider, the fetch calls will work as long as the files are present.

- Simple SVG-like bar chart (built with divs) populated from JSON.
- Accordion FAQs and keyboard accessible modals and rows.
